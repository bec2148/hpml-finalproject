# HPML Final Project
High Performance Machine Learning Final Project

The purpose of this project is to determine if precalculating Edge Detection speeds up knowledge distillation and improves inference accuracy.

## Files
- CIFAR10_distillation.ipynb  The plain vanilla CIFAR10 distillation logic.  A baseline.
- CIFAR10_distillation_edge_detect.ipynb  Precalculates Edge Detection.  The results of this code are compared against the baseline.
- MNIST_distillation.ipynb  The plain vanilla MNIST distillation logic.  The MNIST baseline.
- MNIST_distillation_edge_detect.ipynb  The plain vanilla MNIST distillation logic.  The MNIST baseline.
- MNIST_finalproject.ipynb  Used for initial dry runs of MNIST processing.
